content = "There is lots of information about what has happened to previous graduates that can help you decide which course might best meet your needs.\n\nGraduate destinations and earnings\nStudents are surveyed six months after they graduate to find out whether they are working, undertaking further study, or seeking work. We publish the results of this survey on Unipedia.\n\nLooking at these results can give you an indication of the likelihood of different outcomes, and you can compare them for courses you are interested in.\n\nYou can sometimes also find more indepth information about what graduates from the course have gone on to do on university and college websites.\n\nWe have data for what graduates are earning six months and three years after graduation.\n\nLearn how to understand data and statistics\nFind out more about our earnings data\nThings to remember when looking at this information:\n\nLabour markets change - earnings data from past graduates can only give an indication of what the labour market and earnings might be like when you graduate.\n\nSalaries vary across regions in the UK – for example a job in London may be paid more highly than a similar job elsewhere. If a lot of graduates from a course go on to work in a higher pay region, the salary from that institution may be higher – this doesn’t necessarily reflect on the course they studied.\nEveryone is different and there are lots of things other than the course that can affect someone’s employments prospects and choices."

content = "We publish information on the percentage of students who stay on the course – this is known as the continuation rate. Look out for low continuation rates on courses as these mean that a lot of students have left the course by the end of the first year. If the course seems really attractive otherwise, ask the university or college the reason why students are leaving the course and look at National Student Survey results to see what previous students think of the course."
